School club converting a 2000 Mazda Miata into an electric vehicle, with guidance from two faculty. A few friends and I rebooted the dormant project, and in a year we got it driving. I've been involved in all facets of the project, but I specialize in the mechanical and electrical teams. I designed and fabricated the electric motor mount and battery cradles, built and wired the components platform and the contactor/fuse box, and wired and configured the battery management system.
