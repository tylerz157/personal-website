I am the hardware engineering lead, robot auxiliary driver, and an outreach member. I am also a Dean's List Finalist, 1 of 200 nationwide selected. We've built a world-class team, breaking world records every year and ranking 6th in the world in the 2022-2023 season.

As the hardware lead, I play a key role in both managing the team and building the robot every year. I guide team meetings where we design robot concepts, build and test prototypes, refine robot subsystems, and communicate between software and strategy teams. During this process, I mentor new members and provide insight to facilitate their learning. Aside from leading the team, I contribute to the robot by designing CAD models and manufacturing custom CNC-milled parts myself. On the drive team, I gain a unique perspective on the robot, which gives me insight on how to improve its design. 

As a member of the outreach board, I share my passion in STEM with the community by introducing robotics and providing resources to underprivileged groups, and reaching out to specialists in the field to learn more. For instance, we taught kids at Mary's Place how to build Lego robots, and sent $2000 in robotics kits to rural areas in China. We also met with the Advanced Robotics Club at UW to learn more about embedded systems.
