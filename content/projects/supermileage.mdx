Led 8+ member team in developing a hydrogen fuel-cell powered motor drive system, optimizing for efficiency. Developed system design for power management board with supercapacitor regenerative breaking and emergency shutdown, and dynamometer board with an isolated modular power stage, both transitioning to STM32. Leading component selection and schematic capture. Managing powertrain budget ($5k) in multiple sustainability funds. Organized clear spreadsheet-based system requriements for efficient task delegation and team workflow. Planned manufacturing timeline and integration with other subteams to meet competition deadlines. 

Designed, soldered, and debugged a 48V-12V buck converter, optimizing efficiency through datasheet analysis, component selection, and PCB layout design. Managing thermal dissipation by calculating MOSFET power loss and component's thermal resistance. Tested buck converter with osilliscope and load bank setup, and achieved 94% efficiency for typical loads.

Assisted in developing a field-oriented control (FOC) BLDC motor controller using ESP32. Planned ESP32 pin layout for analog signal quality, preventing H-bridge shoot-through on abnormal boot behavior, and debuggability. Calculated MOSFET thermal dissipation to ensure comfortable operating temperatures. 

Set up vehicle control unit testbench for the AEM VCU300, quickly familiarizing myself with specialized software. Configured and monitored motor torque requests via CAN bus.
