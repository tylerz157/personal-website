This project delivers a fast, accessible dashboard for decision makers. It uses streaming APIs to update charts without full page reloads, and focuses on quick navigation and clarity.

## Highlights

- Real-time updates using Server-Sent Events
- Lazy-loaded chart modules
- Role-based navigation and permissions

Here is a wide shot of a typical dashboard view:

Between content blocks, images sit naturally and scale to the viewport. Text continues after images without layout shifts.

### Implementation notes

We kept the interface minimal. Cards provide quick summaries and link to deeper reports.
